												Design Pattern
what?
	A design patterns are well-proved solution for solving the specific problem/task.
why?
	solving the specific problem/task
	
Note :   every design pattern has some specification or set of rules for solving the problems.
Advantage of design pattern:
	-They are reusable in multiple projects.
	-They provide the solutions that help to define the system architecture.
	-They capture the software engineering experiences.
	-They provide transparency to the design of an application.
	-They are well-proved and testified solutions since they have been built upon the knowledge and experience of expert software developers.
	-Design patterns don?t guarantee an absolute solution to a problem. They provide clarity to the system architecture and the possibility of building a better system.
When should we use the design patterns?
	We must use the design patterns during the analysis and requirement phase of SDLC(Software Development Life Cycle).
Categorization of design patterns:
	two parts:
		Core Java (or JSE) Design Patterns.
		JEE Design Patterns.
1.Creational Design Pattern

2. Structural Design Pattern
	Adapter Pattern
	Bridge Pattern
	Composite Pattern
	Decorator Pattern
	Facade Pattern
	Flyweight Pattern
