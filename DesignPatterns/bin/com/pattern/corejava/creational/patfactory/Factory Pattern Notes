Factory Method Pattern
	just define an interface or abstract class for creating an object but let the subclasses decide which class to instantiate.
	In other words, subclasses are responsible to create the instance of the class.
	The Factory Method Pattern is also known as Virtual Constructor.
Advantage of Factory Design Pattern
	Factory Method Pattern allows the sub-classes to choose the type of objects to create.
	It promotes the loose-coupling by eliminating the need to bind application-specific classes into the code.
